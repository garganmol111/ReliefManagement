# TEKsystem Hiring Hackathon

Our project submission for TEKsystem hackathon

# Problem Statement :fire: :fire: :fire:
**Disaster Relief Management System**
>  The project is an Angular app for TEKsystem hiring challenge, where we try to solve the problems commonly faced during disaster management like double spending and stuff. 
>  Using Angular for front-end and business logic and Firebase for database

# Pain Point 
>   In the times of natural disasters, the adversely affected areas face a communication blackout . This  leads to lack of connectivity  between the NGOs and rescue teams.
>   The relief teams stay unaware of the severity of the conditions in the zones where help is required the most. This outcomes in shortage of assets or alleviation materials in the areas where it is needed the most.

# Proposed Solution
>   We propose a web based application, where NGOs can connect with the PoC(Person of Contact) and reach out to the places with most impact. The PoCs  can also broadcast a request for help.
